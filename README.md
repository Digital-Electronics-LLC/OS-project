# RubixOS
RubixOS is a simple OS inspired by GR8NIX and written in VSPL and RX asm.

## The Story

Once upon a time there was this person named DiamondCoder1000. He came across this project called GR8NIX and got inspired by it. So, he went onto Github.com and created something called Crylix. Crylix was quickly renamed to CrylonOS and the basis for Rubix was born on September 1. He then decided to redo the whole system and on December 22, 3 months after the birth of Crylon, RubixOS was created, with the code heavily based on the original CrylonOS.
